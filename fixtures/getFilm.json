  "plot": "On the lightly snowy evening of January 6, 1904 in Dublin, elderly spinster sisters Kate and Julia and their niece, Mary Jane - all music teachers or performers, past or present - are hosting their annual Epiphany party and dinner, and, with the exception of Mary Jane's new crop of students and the young gentlemen tasked with keeping them company, most of the guests have attended in previous years. Kate and Julia's nephew Gabriel and his wife Gretta hold integral roles for the evening, Gabriel, who, in addition to being Freddy Malins' caregiver if he gets too drunk as is often the case, is to carve the dinner goose and provide the evening's main toast, while Gretta is to present the pudding. With the added unexpected excitement provided by Irish nationalist Molly Ivors for Gabriel, the party basically goes according to script. As most of the guests have departed and just before Gabriel and Gretta are to do the same - this year they staying in a downtown hotel instead of making the long trek to their suburban home and children - something happens to makes Gretta enter into a moment of deep reflection. Gretta confessing the cause and the item of reflection later at the hotel to Gabriel leads to Gabriel, as a culmination of the evening's sum total of events, also entering into reflection, about his and Gretta's marriage, and about life and death in general.",

Horse-drawn carriages arrive with guests on the snowy night.\r\nFirst to enter are three of Mary Jane’s music students, Miss Furlong, Miss O'Callaghan, and Miss Higgins, followed by young bachelors, Joseph Kerrigan and Raymond Bergin. Miss Furlong formally introduces them to Kate and her frail older sister, Julia. Kate’s favorite nephew, Gabriel Conroy, and his wife, Gretta, arrive, followed by a drunken Freddy Malins. Gabriel promptly escorts Freddy to the restroom to sober him up. To Kate’s consternation, Dan Brown, the group’s only Protestant, also arrives in a light state of inebriation.\r\nBefore dinner, the guests dance, and Bartell D’Arcy, a \"celebrated tenor,\" waltzes with Gretta, as Gabriel exchanges glances with a young stranger, Molly Ivors. Meanwhile, Mrs. Malins finds her son Freddy drinking with Dan Brown, and berates him for not meeting her earlier, as she has just arrived from Scotland, where she lives with her daughter. As fellow guest, Mr. Grace, recites a poem in Irish, (\"Donal Óg\") a lament of lost love, Gretta’s eyes grow misty.\r\nAfterward, Kate introduces Gabriel to Molly Ivors. Dancing together, Molly, an Irish nationalist, chides Gabriel for writing at an English newspaper and not learning Irish. He declares that he is sick of Ireland. Julia entertains her guests by singing an operatic piece from her \"concert days.\" Despite her warbling voice, Freddy drunkenly gushes over her performance. Kate complains that the Pope ended her sister’s singing career in the church choir when he replaced women with boys. Molly Ivors is called away for a union meeting, as the guests are called to the table, where a sumptuous feast awaits. Conversation topics range from opera to morality, and Freddy reliably utters the wrong things. Despite his nerves, Gabriel gives a rousing dinner speech praising his aunts’ Irish hospitality.\r\nLater, as the party ends and guests begin to leave, Mrs. Malins asks Gabriel to look after Freddy when she returns to Scotland. Gabriel awakens Dan Brown in the coatroom and puts him in a carriage with the Malins. The remaining guests become still as D'Arcy sings \"The Lass of Aughrim,\" and Gabriel watches his wife, Gretta, standing transfixed on the stairs. She is pensive in the carriage on the way to their hotel, dismissing Gabriel’s attempt to cheer her.\r\nIn their room, Gretta rebuffs his urge to make love. When Gabriel asks about her behavior on the staircase, Gretta explains that she was reminded of a boy named Michael Furey who once sang \"The Lass of Aughrim\" in a pure tenor, on one of their country walks in County Galway. Gretta believes she is partly responsible for Michael’s death from consumption at age seventeen: On the snowy night she was to leave for a Dublin convent, the boy left his sick bed and stood outside her window to say goodbye, and died a week later. After Gretta cries herself to asleep, Gabriel is overcome with jealousy. Watching the snowfall outside, he thinks of his foolish party speech, and his Aunt Julia’s haggard appearance as she sang. He knows she will soon be dead, and imagines his aunt’s body laid out, himself dressed in black as he searches for the right words to recite. Gabriel realizes that his wife’s love for him is not as strong as he once thought, and wishes in turn that he felt a love as powerful as what Michael Furey seemed to feel for Gretta.\r\nAdaptation\r\nThis film adaptation by John Huston's son Tony Huston can be considered a close adaptation of Joyce's short story, with some alterations made to the dialogue to aid the narrative for cinema audiences.\r\nThe most significant change to the story was the inclusion of a new character, a Mr. Grace, who recites an eighth-century Middle Irish poem, \"Donal Óg\".\r\nCast\r\nAnjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy\r\nDonal McCann as Gabriel Conroy\r\nCathleen Delany as Julia Morkan\r\nHelena Carroll as Kate Morkan\r\nRachael Dowling as Lily, the maid\r\nIngrid Craigie as Mary Jane, the niece\r\nDan O'Herlihy as Dan Browne\r\nMarie Kean as Mrs. Malins\r\nDonal Donnelly as Theodore Alfred \"Freddy\" Malins\r\nSean McClory as Mr. Grace\r\nFrank Patterson as Bartell D'Arcy\r\nMaria McDermottroe as Molly Ivors\r\nMaria Hayden as Miss O’Callaghan\r\nKate O'Toole as Miss Furlong\r\nBairbre Dowling as Miss Higgins\r\nColm Meaney as Raymond Bergin\r\nCormac O’Herlihy as Joseph Kerrigan\r\nLyda Anderson as Miss Daly\r\nDara Clarke as Young Lady\r\nPaul Grant as 1st Young Gentleman\r\nPaul Carroll as 2nd Young Gentleman\r\nPatrick Gallagher as 3rd Young Gentleman\r\nBrendan Dillon as Carman\r\nRedmond Gleeson as Nightporter\r\nProduction\r\nChris Sievernich and Weiland Schulz-Keil had raised money for Under the Volcano and would do likewise for The Dead. Screen rights to the story were purchased from the Joyce estate for $60,000. Shooting began 19 January 1987.\r\nAccording to Pauline Kael, \"Huston directed the movie, at eighty, from a wheelchair, jumping up to look through the camera, with oxygen tubes trailing from his nose to a portable generator; most of the time, he had to watch the actors on a video monitor outside the set and use a microphone to speak to the crew. Yet he went into dramatic areas that he'd never gone into before - funny, warm family scenes that might be thought completely out of his range. Huston never before blended his actors so intuitively, so musically.\" According to Anjelica Huston, her father remained a filmmaking virtuoso despite his ill health: \"He was so sick, but he could literally do it with his eyes closed. He knew when we were going to get a take way long before the camera rolled. I mean the timing was so precise that he could tell everything, exactly how it was going to go.\" The pressures of filming and watching her father's health deteriorate had an adverse effect on Anjelica Huston's own health: she developed Epstein-Barr syndrome during production.\r\nRelease\r\nThe Dead was initially released on DVD by Lionsgate on November 3, 2009.
